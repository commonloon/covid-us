# covid-us
Originally a flask app to plot covid new case data for all US states; expanded to plot data for other regions.

I created this app as an exercise to help me learn to use the d3 javascript library.

As a follow-on, I modified it to deploy to AWS Lambda to avoid paying for an EC2 instance to run it.
I use the "serverless" framework to deploy the app, following the tutorial at https://www.serverless.com/blog/flask-python-rest-api-serverless-lambda-dynamodb

This is my first Lambda app, so I've probably done some stuff non-optimally.

This is a personal project, which I tinker with as I have time and inclination.  Feel free to file issues; I'll take them into account when I prioritize new work.
